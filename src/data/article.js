     but each of them caught in the Lestead region goes to the deep 
     dungeons of the city so that alchemists can create potions based 
     on rare ingredients. The inhabitants of Lestead have arranged from 
     the dungeons what they call Fields of Battle Chasers, for a small fee,
      anyone who is brave enough can try their hand against randomly 
      selected monsters ... calmly, the manager of Fields of Battle Chasers
     has already fought more than one fight, so he will choose opponents based
     on your experience. If you defeat all hostile creatures, a special chest with random 
    treasures will be waiting for you.
  
    Dungeon battles are becoming so popular that other regions outside of Lestead are also considering
     creating them.`,
